# Why?? 
# _*Problem Statement*_

#### Personalization in a crowded branch 
#### Ability to differentiate between a potential customers and existing customers 
#### People change over time and the photo in the system may not be as accurate anymore 
#### More physical branch data to improve navigation


## _*Solutions*_

#### _*This solution leverages Artificial Intelligence by bringing in Four distinct solutions.*_ 
##### -The first aspect of our solution is that we register the customer by creating a dataset and adding photos into it. 
##### -The second aspect of our solution is to Train the Artificial Intelligence Model.
##### -The third aspect of our solution is recognize the customer by using AI recognition system 
##### - The fourth aspect is to pull and display Customer information and Recent Transaction History. 

## _*How this solution will help FIS and its Clients*_

##  _*User Identification (UI) helps:*_
#### _*Increase branch personalization and sales by identifying new potential customers*_ 
##### -Informs bank managers of branch behavior
##### -Confirms identity to support KYC when making changes
##### -Eliminates the guess work at identifying the person who checked in for an appointment
#### _*Identify common customer flow during peak hours to improve branch navigation*_
#### _*Potential customers to existing customer ratio on a daily or monthly basis*_

## _*Technology Stack*_

##### -Python 3.7
##### -Anaconda 3.x
##### -OpenCV 
##### -Flask 3.x
##### -HTML
##### -Artificial Intelligence
##### -Machine Learning 
##### -Deep Learning

## _*Future Enhancements*_

##### -Are customers happy when they walk in? Are they still happy when they walk out?
##### - Detect suspicious behavior branch and ATM manipulations. 
##### -APIs to the Banker platform for KYC


## _*How to use it?*_

##### - Install all the dependencies that are mentioned in the Technology Stack Section.
##### - Now train the algorithm by executing Facedetectandtrain.py module.
##### - Then, run Face_Authorization.py module to recognize the person by using the face recognition method.
##### - After the person is identified and recognized, then close the active camera by pressing the Escape key from keyboard.
##### - After that, this process retrieves the last transaction history of the identified customer from the database and displays them on the screen.
